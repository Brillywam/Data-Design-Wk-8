## 📝 Description
This is the **Week 8 Assignment** for Database Design. It implements a simple **Inventory Tracking System** using MySQL. The system includes tables for managing items, suppliers, orders, and order details, with proper relationships and constraints.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open **MySQL Workbench** or any SQL client.
2. Import the `answers.sql` file:
   - Copy the SQL script from `answers.sql`.
   - Paste it into your SQL editor.
   - Execute the script to create the database and tables.
3. (Optional) Add sample data using `INSERT INTO` statements to test the database.

## 📂 Files
- **`answers.sql`**: Contains the SQL schema for the database, including `CREATE TABLE` statements and relationships.
- **ERD Screenshot**: Visual representation of the database structure.

## 🛠️ Features
